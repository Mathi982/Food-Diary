# Food-Diary

Food Diary Functionality:

* Adding Food Items: Users can add details about the food they consume throughout the day, such as its name, weight, calories, protein content, and price. This information gets stored in a CSV file (food_items.csv).
* Categorization: Food items can be categorized into different categories and subcategories, allowing users to organize their food entries effectively.
* Search Functionality: Users can search for specific food items either by name or category, making it easier to find and log their meals.
* Displaying Food Items: Users can view a list of all the food items they've added, along with their nutritional information and prices.

Plans for Updates:

* Meal Plan Functionality: Implementing a feature where users can create meal plans for their day or week. This functionality would allow users to specify meals they plan to consume, along with their quantities and timings. The meal plan could then provide an overview of their daily or weekly food intake.
* Food Log: Introducing a food log feature would enable users to keep track of their daily food consumption. Users could log each meal or snack they consume, providing insights into their eating habits and helping them make healthier choices.
* Data Visualization: Implementing data visualization tools would enable users to visualize their food intake data through charts, graphs, and statistics. Visual representations of their eating habits could help users identify patterns, set goals, and track their progress over time.
